# Design a Page Application

Put the files *page_design_form.html* and *display_page.php* on a web server. Make sure you can view the pages in a browser. Select a text colour and enter some heading text and submit the form. *display_page.php* should be displayed and use these values to build a simple HTML page.

* Check this works and you understand what is happening.

Then try the following:-

1. Add some more code to *display_page.php* that will use the other values from the form i.e. it will build a simple page with a user specified background colour, font and body text.

2. Add some validation.
    * Add some simple validation to determine whether or not the user has completed all the fields.
    * Make sure the user has selects different colours for the background and the text

3. Make a 'postback' form
    * Modify your application to create a 'postback' form, where the PHP code and the HTML form are in a single file.
